Welcome to my Individual Project for Semester 2 in Fontys. This application is called GTracker, which is an abbreviation for GameTracker.

With this application, Users are able to add their own games to their list and categorise it in different statuses: Wishlist, Finished, Currently Playing and Owned. Every User has their own personalised list: <img width="1847" height="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e03c9a-4c9b-4d73-b9c5-d291c53553d0" />


and is able to add a game by clicking on the green button that says "Add Game".
The user then fills in the Game Title, Platform, Release Year, Genre, image and notes (the last 2 are optional). The status can be selected from a dropdown menu. Then the user can click on the blue button with "Add Game" and the Game will show up in the list! Information about the added games can also be edited by simply clicking on the "Edit" button on the game list. Games can also easily be deleted by clicking on the red "Delete" button, this will show a confirmation message in case the user clicked on it by accident: <img width="1823" height="538" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dced5bd0-78b2-4b17-b56c-1efbf4f6ea43" />

Ratings can also be added to every game, to do this, click on the "Add Rating" button on the game list page and choose the amount of stars ranging from 1-5. Once a rating has been added, the user can freely edit it as well using the "Edit Rating" button.

Users can choose to view a game once they've added it as well, this shows all of the information they've added to the game (including the box art): <img width="1407" height="825" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a8bb876-e6a0-4cfb-973a-448ba2c309dc" />

Searching games with the use of a filter is also possible. Users can fill in part of the title of a Game or fill in the Release Year, Genre, Platform and Status. Only the games that correspond to the filled in details will show up.
From the list, Users can also easily delete, edit and view their game by clicking on the buttons with said names.

There is a profile page for users as well, accessed by clicking on the circle in the top right corner. Here users can add their own personal Profile Picture (max. resolution = 400x400) which after uploading will show up in the top right corner! This is what the profile page looks like: <img width="1270" height="714" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/568f9583-efd0-45cc-bdb5-7545d5f2aa93" /> 

After uploading: <img width="448" height="128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96db45d1-ea95-4bfd-9a11-f0fa41efe10f" />


If the User wishes to clear their session and Log Out, they can easily click on the "Log Out" button at the top. The session gets cleared and the user has to log in/register again:
