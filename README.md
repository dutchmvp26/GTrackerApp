Welcome to my Individual Project for Semester 2 in Fontys. This application is called GTracker, which is an abbreviation for GameTracker.

With this application, Users are able to add their own games to their list and categorise it in different statuses: Wishlist, Finished, Currently Playing and Owned. Every User has their own personalised list: <img width="1916" height="863" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dcf0b36-c210-4655-9d62-c06e3f0bcef5" />

and is able to add a game by clicking on the green button that says "Add Game".
The user then fills in the Game Title, Platform, Release Year, Genre and notes (this one is optional). The status can be selected from a dropdown menu. Then the user can click on the blue button with "Add Game" and the Game will show up in the list!

Searching games with the use of a filter is also possible. Users can fill in part of the title of a Game or fill in the Release Year, Genre, Platform and Status. Only the games that correspond to the filled in details will show up.
From the list, Users can also easily delete, edit and view their game by clicking on the buttons with said names.

If the User wishes to clear their session and Log Out, they can easily click on the "Log Out" button at the top. The session gets cleared and the user has to log in/register again:
